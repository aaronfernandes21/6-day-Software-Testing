## ðŸ“˜ Day-2: Building and Deploying a Portfolio using Python

Day-2 of the Skill Lab focused on helping students **build their own personal portfolio websites** using Python. The session provided a step-by-step walkthrough of setting up a basic portfolio project from scratch. Students learned how to design and develop their portfolio using Python-based tools and frameworks, allowing them to showcase their skills, projects, and professional profiles in an organized manner.

An important concept introduced during this session was the use of **virtual environments (venv)**. Students were taught how to create and manage isolated Python environments for their projects, ensuring cleaner development workflows and avoiding dependency conflicts. This practice is essential in professional development environments and was emphasized as a best practice.

By the end of the session, each student had not only created their own functioning portfolio but also **successfully deployed it online**, making it accessible through a live URL. This gave them firsthand experience in turning a local project into a publicly accessible web applicationâ€”a key step in modern development and personal branding.

Overall, Day-2 laid a strong foundation in **Python-based web development**, **environment management**, and **web deployment**, giving students confidence and motivation to continue building and sharing their work online.
