## ðŸ“˜ Day-4: Deployment and Git Fundamentals

On Day-4 of the Skill Lab session, students were introduced to the practical aspects of web deployment and version control using Git. With the assistance of the tutor, a key hands-on activity involved deploying a portfolio website and successfully hosting it on **Render**, a cloud platform for web services. This exercise provided a comprehensive understanding of how web deployment works, covering the process of taking a local web project and making it live on the internet.

In addition to deployment, the session focused on the essential concepts of **Git**, a widely-used version control system. Students learned how to **clone repositories** to work on local versions of online projects, and how to **fork existing repositories**â€”a critical skill when contributing to open-source or collaborative development. The process of **pushing code changes** to a remote repository was also practiced, reinforcing the importance of keeping project versions updated and well-managed.

Overall, the session offered valuable exposure to industry-relevant tools and practices. By the end of Day-4, students had gained a strong foundational understanding.
